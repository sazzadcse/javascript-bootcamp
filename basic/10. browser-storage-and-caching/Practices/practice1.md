Consider the object below. Suppose we want to store this object
in the localStorage and sessionStorage of our browser. How can we do that?
Also how can you can read this object from the localStorage and sessionStorage?

```javascript
let team = {
    name: "Real Madrid",
    ucl: 13,
    laliga: 33
}
```
