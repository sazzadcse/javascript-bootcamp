<!-- In this example, we will see an example of Throttling.
As we already know, Throttling is a technique, 
to limit the execution of an event handler function, 
even when this event triggers continuously due to user actions.

Suppose an app sends OTP for login everytime, and it wants to 
limit sending OTPS to users to login. In 10 seconds time margin, user can only
get otp once, meaning he/she can only login to the app one time in 10
seconds timeframe. We can implement this using Throttling -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <title>Throttling</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button onclick="getOTP()">Get OTP for Login</button>
    <script>
        const otp = ()=> {
            console.log("Here's your OTP code")
        }
        // throttling function
        const throttleFunction = (func, interval) => {
            let shouldSend = true;
            return function(){
                if(shouldSend){
                    func();
                    shouldSend = false;
                    setTimeout(()=>{
                        shouldSend = true;
                    }, interval)
                }
            }
        }
        const getOTP = throttleFunction(otp, 10000);

    </script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Here, in this code, even if the users try to login in the app
many times, he/she can only get otp one time in 10 seconds, he/she needs to wait
10 seconds to login again -->
